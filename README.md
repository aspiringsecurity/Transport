Our solution offers an Artificial Intelligence-based object detection system that utilizes Polkadot, Intel one API toolkit and ethereum blockchain solutions powered by IPFS storage for sorting information obtained from a variety of road junctions, cameras deployed at monitoring spots.

Our app solution will enable effective design, engineering and delivery of  Polkadot, Intel one API toolkit aided solution to make roads safer and better using predictive analytics and automation for incident reporting and reduction in hazardous transportation with capabilities pluggable and extendable to 5 different personas: Driver, Police, Citizen, Dispatcher, Admin. Our solution will benefit: 

Police Force 
- 360 degrees access of the incidents to the action/ administration team. They can manage the complete lifecycle of incident reporting, overall status, traffic monitoring, managing police teams. Using machine learning they can also predict the incident occurrence at any area. This will help in taking necessary actions in advance to control the traffic. They can also use the solution for effective utilization of staff members and provide road safety counselling.

Ministry of Road and Transportation: Endeavor to change the car accident scenario by use of car technology to make driving safer and monitored for drivers, authorities, as well as other 3rd parties. With a mix of hardware and software, we will provide intelligent feedback about drive quality and help analyze past incidents, as well as predict future incidents.

Citizens and Cab aggregators: Reduction in the number of road accidents.

Insurance Companies: Aggregated/ anonymized driving data and incident data will be helpful to car insurance companies.

OEMs and Dealerships: Vehicle diagnostics and in-car service consumption will be helpful for OEMs and Dealerships.

Smart Cities Policy Makers/ Government: Real time traffic flow, incident alert and parking data will be enable safer roads.

Advertisers: Customers/driver demographics will be available.

Fleet customers: fleet performance, compare against competition.

Polkadot, Ink Smart Contracts and Intel oneAPI toolkit: We are using Polkadot, Ink Smart Contracts and Intel oneAPI for solving multiple challenges in investigative case management of road incidents for the admin role: sentiment analysis of a particular road incident for the admin role, social media text mining for a road incident and classification and severity of the incidents, early stage incident response and prevention.
