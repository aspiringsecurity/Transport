# Contributing

**interBTC** is an open-source software project, providing a 1:1 Bitcoin-backed asset - fully collateralized, interoperable, and censorship-resistant.

This project provides a graphql data query layer via squid.

## Rules

There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors (including the maintainer(s) of the project):

- **Master** must have the latest changes and its history must never be re-written.
- **Non-master branches** must be prefixed with the _type_ of ongoing work.
- **All modifications** must be made in a **pull-request** to solicit feedback from other contributors.
- **All commits** must be **signed**, have a clear commit message to better track changes, and must follow the [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/#summary) standard.
- **All tags** must follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
