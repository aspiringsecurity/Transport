Pitch Deck: 

Our solution offers an Artificial Intelligence-based object detection system that utilizes Polkadot, Intel one API toolkit and ethereum blockchain solutions powered by IPFS storage for sorting information obtained from a variety of road junctions, cameras deployed at monitoring spots.

Our app solution will enable effective design, engineering and delivery of  Polkadot, Intel one API toolkit aided solution to make roads safer and better using predictive analytics and automation for incident reporting and reduction in hazardous transportation with capabilities pluggable and extendable to 5 different personas: Driver, Police, Citizen, Dispatcher, Admin. Our solution will benefit: 

Police Force 
- 360 degrees access of the incidents to the action/ administration team. They can manage the complete lifecycle of incident reporting, overall status, traffic monitoring, managing police teams. Using machine learning they can also predict the incident occurrence at any area. This will help in taking necessary actions in advance to control the traffic. They can also use the solution for effective utilization of staff members and provide road safety counselling.

Ministry of Road and Transportation: Endeavor to change the car accident scenario by use of car technology to make driving safer and monitored for drivers, authorities, as well as other 3rd parties. With a mix of hardware and software, we will provide intelligent feedback about drive quality and help analyze past incidents, as well as predict future incidents.

Citizens and Cab aggregators: Reduction in the number of road accidents.

Insurance Companies: Aggregated/ anonymized driving data and incident data will be helpful to car insurance companies.

OEMs and Dealerships: Vehicle diagnostics and in-car service consumption will be helpful for OEMs and Dealerships.

Smart Cities Policy Makers/ Government: Real time traffic flow, incident alert and parking data will be enable safer roads.

Advertisers: Customers/driver demographics will be available.

Fleet customers: fleet performance, compare against competition.


# Architecture

Data DAO for Monitoring, Incident Management, preserving vital data;  Decentralized NFT voting system for contract work by service providers, Votes are uploaded to IPFS with the most recent vote linking to one before, Creating an NFT on the for NFC tags of vehicles.


# Polkadot, Ink Smart Contracts and Intel oneAPI toolkit 

We are using Polkadot, Ink Smart Contracts and Intel oneAPI for solving multiple challenges in investigative case management of road incidents for the admin role: sentiment analysis of a particular road incident for the admin role, social media text mining for a road incident and classification and severity of the incidents, early stage incident response and prevention.

# Intel one API specific instructions

1. Intel oneapi powered analytics, navigation and inspection using UAVs and drones using NXP iot modular gateway: We are extending the example of navigation and inspection using drones to enable local air traffic control,  detecting and managing drones and setting up geo-fences, communication setup for drones using predictive analytics and automation. Please visit: https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/Transport/tree/main/roadincidentmanagement/transport-intel-oneapi-analytics/incident-oneapi-analytics-navigation-inspection 

Features:

•Detection : Identifying the drones & UAVs in the video feed using object detection.

•Discovery : Logging the identities of the drones & UAVs flying in a particular air space at any instant of time, using exchange of unique identifiers. 

•Geo-fencing : Discovering unlawful presence and raising alarms using the detection & discovery data.

•Monitoring : Looking out and reporting incidents based on event detection in visual data.

•Analysis : Analyzing route patterns and incidents.     

•Drone Incident Reporting : Publish drone incident reports.

2. Intel oneapi Spare parts billing and automation using onchain/offchain payments: Please visit https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/Transport/tree/main/dot-analytics-tooling/transport-intel-oneapi-analytics/spare-parts-intel-oneapi-invoice-to-cash-automation

We are extending the example of intel oneapi powered invoice to cash automation to develop an invoicing suite and Web3 Car Parts Dashboard that enables Transport Ministry and third party service and repair organizations to keep track of all the details of their transport assets, DeFi investments, transactions, and assets across all multiple chains and also displays DAO data using a data visualization chart. We are building our solution on top of an existing web3 dashboard system and wish to integrate an analytics, tabulation and collaboration tool namely EtherCalc.
