# Intel oneapi powered analytics, navigation and inspection using UAVs and drones using NXP iot modular gateway

We are extending the example of navigation and inspection using drones to enable local air traffic control, detecting and managing drones and setting up geo-fences, communication setup for drones using predictive analytics and automation.

Features:

•Detection : Identifying the drones & UAVs in the video feed using object detection.

•Discovery : Logging the identities of the drones & UAVs flying in a particular air space at any instant of time, using exchange of unique identifiers.

•Geo-fencing : Discovering unlawful presence and raising alarms using the detection & discovery data.

•Monitoring : Looking out and reporting incidents based on event detection in visual data.

•Analysis : Analyzing route patterns and incidents.

•Drone Incident Reporting : Publish drone incident reports.
