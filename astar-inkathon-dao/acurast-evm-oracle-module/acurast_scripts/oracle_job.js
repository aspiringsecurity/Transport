/**
 * This Oracle Script observes the BTC USDT Pair and posts the price on-chain.
 * Deploying the script is easy using console.acurast.com and simply copy/pasting
 * this script. Make sure to update `DESTINATION_CONTRACT` and `EVM_RPC_NODE` to 
 * reflect your deployment. For RPC's with API keys like i.e. infura make sure
 * to work with the Acurast confidential environment variables. After having set
 * them for your job, you can access them easily with a `_STD_.env["MY_KEY"]`. They 
 * also come in handy for paid API KEYs, that you don't want to share publicly.
